# Roadmap #

### Step 1: Define Project Scope and Requirements
- **Identify the core features and functionalities** of your fitness application.
- **Gather requirements** for the user interface, user experience, and business logic.

### Step 2: Sketch Data Model and Entity Relationships
- **Design a high-level data model** including entities like User, Workout, Exercise, etc.
- **Sketch the relationships** between these entities using a whiteboard or digital tools like Lucidchart.

### Step 3: Set Up Development Environment
- **Install necessary tools** for development (e.g., Visual Studio, Node.js, Expo CLI).
- **Initialize a new project** in React Native using Expo and a .NET project for your backend.

### Step 4: Implement Backend with .NET
- **Create a basic .NET API** using the MVC pattern.
- **Set up Entity Framework** with SQLite for initial development.
- **Implement OAuth2 authentication** for user login and registration.

### Step 5: Develop Frontend with React Native
- **Start building the UI** of your application using React Native.
- **Integrate OAuth2 authentication flow** for user login/registration.
- **Connect frontend to backend** via API calls for user actions.

### Step 6: Version Control with GitHub
- **Initialize a Git repository** in your project.
- **Commit your code regularly** and push to a GitHub repository.

### Step 7: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with Azure DevOps
- **Connect Azure DevOps to your GitHub repository**.
- **Configure build pipelines** for both frontend and backend.
- **Set up release pipelines** for automated deployment.
- **Manage environment secrets** securely, possibly using Azure Key Vault.

### Step 8: Test Backend and Frontend Integration
- **Run your backend locally** and test API endpoints.
- **Test the frontend interaction** with the backend (login, data fetching, etc.).
- **Use tools like Postman** for API testing and debugging.

### Step 9: Deploy Backend to a Cloud Service
- **Choose a cloud service** for backend deployment (e.g., Azure, AWS).
- **Deploy your .NET application** to the cloud service.
- **Configure your database** for production (consider migrating from SQLite to a more robust database if necessary).

### Step 10: Build and Test the Mobile App
- **Run and test the app** in Expo Go for local testing.
- **Build the application** using Expo's build services.

### Step 11: Prepare for App Store Submission
- **Gather all necessary metadata** (descriptions, screenshots, etc.).
- **Configure Expo to deploy** to Google Play and the App Store.
- **Test the release builds** thoroughly.

### Step 12: Continuous Monitoring and Feedback
- **Monitor the application performance** using tools like Azure Monitor or Application Insights.
- **Gather user feedback** to iterate and improve the application.
- **Refine and update** both frontend and backend as needed.

### Step 13: Regular Maintenance and Updates
- **Keep your application updated** with the latest libraries and frameworks.
- **Regularly review and update** your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Stay compliant** with security and privacy standards.
